# Down-payment-Calculations
The following python code is used to calculate the number of months of saving needed to pay for the down payment (portion_down_payment) of a house. The code requests the user to enter various inputs that is used to calculate the final answer. The core of the code is the additions onto current savings (which is used to pay for the down payment). Essentially, current savings is a function of a monthly portion of salary and return on investments (.04). Semi-annual raises every 6 months increases salary, thereby increasing the rate at which current savings grows. These changing inputs are added to current savings at the end of each month, until current savings meets the dollar amount required to pay the down payment. When this happens, the program will print the number of months that was counted in the loop.
